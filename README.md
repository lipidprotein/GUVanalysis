# Overview



# Running the demo

Sample image files are in zip format due to the storage limit. They can be unzipped into the exactly the same folder to run the demo. Each program has the master demo file to run. 


# Platform:

Program 1 was written for GNU Octave and Program 2 and 3 were written for MATLAB. For MATLAB codes, deep learning and image processing tool boxes were used.
