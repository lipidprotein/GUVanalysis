% Program 2 
% CNN based vesicle selectioni and intensity computation to determine
% final phase domain separation. 
%
% This code was written for MATLAB R2020b.
%
% Running this script will show an example analysis using program 2
% In this example, single color stacks with assorted phase separation
% images will be analyzed (fluorophore is TopFluor-Cholesterol)
% Pre-trained neural network information is included in the file 'nrFilter4C.mat'
% which is used for this demo. 
% Detailed results, if needed will be saved in a folder 'Sample/Analysis'
